## Random User Browser

A simple Android app to consume the feeds from
[Randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) API endpointsâ€‹

For example, a list of 200 random users can be found at:
[https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&seed=yv](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&seed=yv)

Clicking on one of the users in the master view will show more details
about that user in the detail view.
